# Mathematical Blog Posts with Jupyter Book
## Quick Start Guide

If your posts contain lots of math along with code (e.g. writing about a new machine learning or robotics research paper), you may find this post useful. On the other hand, if your posts are mostly about code (e.g. writing about how to use an existing package / library), this post may be overkill for you.

The beautiful and powerful [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) ecosystem is meant for writing online books with publication quality content. However, we will be using this ecosystem to write a short blog post, a.k.a. *an article* in Jupyter Book parlance. Jupyter book offers tremendous functionality and flexibility, but we will focus on getting up-and-running quickly by creating a post from a single markdown file.
Detailed instructions are available in the `main.md` file.
