My name is Ayush Bharadwaj. I am a "full stack" data scientist (data >> math >> software). I enjoy applying ideas from mathematics, statistics, machine learning, operations research and software engineering to solve hard and ill-defined problems. I am currently interested in the theory and applications of mathematical optimization to Finance, Logistics and Energy domains.
