My name is Ayush Bharadwaj. I am a "full stack" data scientist. I enjoy applying ideas from mathematics, statistics, machine learning, operations research and software engineering to solve hard and ill-defined problems.

I am passionate about the theory as well as applications of mathematical optimization to real world problems. I have a masters degree in operations research and I recently completed my (second) masters degree in mathematics focusing on algebraic geometry and convex optimization.
I am currently interested in advanced applications of optimization in Finance, Logistics and Energy domains.
