My name is Ayush Bharadwaj. I am a *full stack* data scientist (data » math » software), and an independent thinker. I enjoy solving hard and ill-defined problems by applying ideas from mathematics, statistics, machine learning, operations research and software engineering to messy, real world data. I am particularly interested in the applications of machine learning and optimization in Energy, Logistics and FinTech domains. I enjoy working on small teams trying to accomplish big things. If you think I can be of help, or if you would like to learn more, feel free to reach out!
