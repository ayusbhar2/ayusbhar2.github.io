As a “full stack” data scientist (data » math » software), I am passionate about solving hard and ill-defined problems by applying ideas from mathematics, statistics, machine learning, operations research and software engineering to messy, real world data.

Optimization skills: Convex/ Non-convex Optimization, Robust Optimization, Network Optimization, Linear/ Mixed-Integer/ Quadratic/ Semidefinite Programming, Metaheuristics

Machine Learning skills: Supervised/ Unsupervised Learning, Anomaly Detection, Ensemble Learning, Feature Engineering, Experiment Design/ Analysis, ML System Design

Whether you're looking for a professional with a firm grasp on theoretical knowledge complemented by practical experience, or simply someone who enjoys the art of articulating complex ideas precisely, feel free to reach out.
