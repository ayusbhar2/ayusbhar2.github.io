My name is Ayush Bharadwaj. I am a "full stack" data scientist. I enjoy applying ideas from mathematics, statistics, machine learning, operations research and software engineering to solve hard and ill-defined problems.

I am passionate about the theory as well as applications of mathematical optimization to real world problems. I have two masters degrees - one in operations research and the other in mathematics (specifically - algebraic geometry and convex optimization).

While optimization is my core competency, I also have significant industry experience in software engineering, data analysis and machine learning. Having this broad skill-set allows me to be innovative, independent and effective in my work.

I enjoy solving bootsrtapping problems and breaking new ground. I thrive in small teams working on hard stuff. I am currently interested in advanced applications of optimization in Finance, Logistics and Energy domains.
