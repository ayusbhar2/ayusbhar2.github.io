My name is Ayush Bharadwaj. As a *full stack* data scientist (data » math » software), I am passionate about solving hard and ill-defined problems by applying ideas from mathematics, statistics, machine learning, operations research and software engineering to messy, real-world data. I am particularly interested in the theory and applications of mathematical optimization in  Energy, Logistics and Finance domains.

I enjoy working on small teams trying to accomplish big things. If you are looking for a professional with broad skills and experience, and the ability to connect serious mathematics with tangible business results, feel free to reach out!
